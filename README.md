  ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
  Software Developer || Team player || Constant Learner || creative enthusiast || Vue.js, C#, Javascript, Node.js, CSS, etc
  
  I am a software developer with a creative flair. Art and coding have been my go to things for as long as I can remember. I got into Art just because I loved to draw and paint and play with 3D programs like blender. I got into coding because my dad is a developer and that was my door into even knowing what software development or even coding was. I wanted to know what it was all about. After some dabbling in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, it turned out I really really enjoyed it. 
  That was just the beginning. With some formal training I am now able to build a full stack application. 
   The most recent tools I use for applications are Vue, C#, and mySQL.
My background before I decided on software development was customer service, screen printing, and childcare. I enjoyed those jobs, but I just wasnâ€™t feeling a connection to them as much as I do with software development.
     Currently while I am looking for opportunities I am working on a personal projects and sprucing up my GitHub.
    I look forward to building new things, learning new tools, and taking on new challenges in the near future.
